 Main track papers will be presented in the format of a panel, consisting of presentations of 7 minutes per paper, followed by a 25 mins panel-style discussion with presenting authors, led by a discussant (session chair). Audience will submit questions for consideration by the discussant. Each paper panel session will also include 1 to 2 pre-recorded paper presentations from authors who cannot attend in person.
 
The provocations session will include 3-minute presentations for each provocation paper, followed by a 15-minute soapbox-style discussion with presenters.
