[ACM](https://acm.org "The Association for Computing Machinery") provides visa support letters to attendees, accepted authors (papers, posters), and members of the conference committee.

There are two ways to request a visa support letter—**please use only one method** to avoid delays:


1. <b>Fastest method: Request through registration</b>     
During the registration process, you will be prompted to enter the necessary information to generate a visa letter automatically through ACM. Letters are typically issued within <b>2 business days</b>.

2. <b>Alternative method (for accepted authors or committee members only): Email request</b>  
If you are not yet registering but require a visa letter (e.g., for early planning), send an email to [supportletters@acm.org](mailto:supportletters@acm.org "Email ACM for a visa support letter"). Please allow up to <b>10 business days</b> for processing. Include the following in your request:

* Full name (as it appears on your passport)
* Current postal mailing address
* Name of the conference: CUI 2025 – <b>Conversational User Interfaces</b>
* Registration confirmation number (if available)
* Title of your accepted paper or poster, and indicate if you are the “sole author” or a “co-author”
* If applicable, title of your presentation (for invited speakers)
    
All requests are processed in the order received.
