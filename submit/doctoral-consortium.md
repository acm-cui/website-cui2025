The CUI {{ site.conference.year }} Doctoral Consortium will be a half-day hybrid session where doctoral students of conversational user interfaces can discuss their research with other students and experts within the field. Doctoral work is important to our rapidly advancing area of research, and we very much look forward to making the Doctoral Consortium a place for students to meet and network.

LaTeX users should have the following document class: <code>\documentclass[sigconf, screen, review]{acmart}</code> for submission.

Word users should use [the double-column "Interim Template"](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template#h-interim-template "ACM Interim Template for submissions").

Your submission should not be anonymized.

The application should be submitted as a single pdf file (max. 2 pages) outlining a research statement which contains the following: 
 
1. A summary of the applicant's research topic  
2. Answers to the following questions:  
	a. How far you are in your PhD?  
	b. What is the motivation for this research?  
	c. What is the expected contribution to the field?  
	d. What progress have you made so far?  
	e. What would you like to learn and discuss during the Doctoral Consortium? 

### 2. Submit your application

You should submit your application via PCS (details to be finalized), making sure to include your full name, affiliation, and preferred contact email on the extended abstract (non-anonymous submission).

**Important:** When submitting your application please indicate if you plan to attend the Doctoral Consortium in person or remotely.


### 3. Selection process â€“ curated

Doctoral Consortium participants will be selected on the basis of their research statement through a curated process where the aim is to establish a participant group with complementary research interests and aims for participation. We aim for an inclusive selection process.
