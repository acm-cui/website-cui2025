## Getting to Waterloo

### By plane

The most convenient airport for reaching Waterloo is **Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ)**. It is approximately 1 hour by car from Pearson to Waterloo. Rental cars, airport shuttles, and rideshare services (e.g., Uber, Lyft) are all available. A taxi or ride-share typically costs **CAD $100–150**.

**Arriving at Billy Bishop Airport**? Getting to Waterloo is straightforward! From the airport, take the free shuttle or a quick taxi ride to Union Station in downtown Toronto. From there, you can catch a **GO Transit train or bus** to Kitchener GO Station—Waterloo's neighboring city. The trip typically takes around **2 to 2.5 hours**. For added convenience, consider booking a **rental car** or a **rideshare service**, which can get you to Waterloo in about **1.5 to 2 hours**, depending on traffic. We recommend planning ahead, especially during peak travel times!

Alternatively, **Region of Waterloo International Airport (YKF)** offers limited direct flights within Canada and the U.S., and is only **20 minutes by car** from the University of Waterloo.

### By train

Via Rail operates regular train service to **Kitchener Station**, which is approximately **15 minutes from the University of Waterloo** by taxi, bus, or light rail (ION). Travelers from Toronto can also take **GO Transit** (bus or train service), which offers affordable and frequent options, especially from **Union Station**.

### By car

Waterloo is easily accessible via **Highway 401** and **Highway 8** from the Greater Toronto Area. Parking is available near campus, but some lots may require permits or payment. We recommend checking University of Waterloo’s parking services page for up-to-date information.



## Getting Around Waterloo

Getting around Waterloo is possible through public transportation operated by Grand River Transit (GRT). GRT operates multiple bus routes, and a light-rail transit line (called the ION) runs through the city, making it easy to travel to Uptown Waterloo, and Kitchener. Cash fares are $3.75 or, a transit card can be purchased for $5 at the University of Waterloo Turnkey Desk in the Student Life Centre (SLC). Each fare is then $3, and can be re-loaded at any ION stop or station. 

University of Waterloo Station is located right outside of Engineering 5 and 7, where most of our workshops and events will be hosted for CUI 2025.  For detailed timetable and real-time route suggestions, please visit [grt.ca.](https://www.grt.ca/en/index.aspx)
