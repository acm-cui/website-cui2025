## Getting to Luxembourg

### By plane

**Luxembourg Airport (Findel):** by far, the most convenient way of air travelling to Luxembourg is to arrive at the national airport. Luxembourg Airport's advantages are its relatively small size and fast and efficient procedures (for instance, one has to be at the airport only one hour before departure). It’s only 20 minutes from the airport to the city centre (Hamilius station) by bus (lines 6 and 16). A taxi from the airport to the city centre can cost around €50. 

**Saarbrucken Airport:** this regional airport is approximately 2 hours by public transport from the City of Luxembourg. Although there is no direct shuttle bus service, you may first visit Saarbrücken-Hbf and then take L40 to reach Luxembourg. The bus arrives every hour, and detailed information can be found on the [CFL website](https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/).

## By train

Luxembourg has train connections to its neighboring countries: France, Germany and Belgium. However, it is also very feasible to travel by train from the Netherlands or the UK. When planning train travel in Europe, the website of [Deutsche Bahn](https://int.bahn.de/en) is an excellent source of information since they have a travel planner that covers almost the entire Europe.

**From Belgium:** A direct train goes once an hour between Brussels and Luxembourg; the trip takes about 3 hours. Another possibility is to take the train Liège–Luxembourg, which might be more direct for some parts of Belgium, but it has to be mentioned that this train makes a lot of stops. For more information, please check the [SNCB website](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en).

**From France:** From Paris, you may consider the direct train TGV Paris–Luxembourg, or transit via Metz. These trips take about 3 hours. For more information, please check the [SNCF website](https://www.sncf.com/en).

**From Germany** Rail travelers coming from Germany can use the railway between Trier and Luxembourg. Trier, however, is a relatively small city not served by the ICE network. The nearest German city on the ICE network is Saarbrucken, which has a direct highway bus connection with Luxembourg (1 hour and 15 minutes). For more information, please visit the [CFL website](https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/).

**From The Netherlands:** Train tickets from the Netherlands to Luxembourg can be bought at the domestic counter or even from the standard NS ticket vending machines (press “Belgium / Luxembourg”). When buying a ticket, one has to specify whether one is going over Roosendaal–Brussels or over Maastricht–Liège. More information can be found on the [NS website](https://www.nsinternational.com/en).

### By car

Driving in the city center of Luxembourg is not always a pleasant experience, partly because many streets are one-way. Also, not every hotel offers parking space. Those who are nevertheless willing to drive can comfort themselves with the fact that Luxembourg has some of the lowest petrol prices in the EU. Free car parks are situated on the city’s outskirts with a regular bus shuttle to the town center.


## Travelling with Luxembourg

Starting in 2020, all public transport (except 1st class) in Luxembourg is free of charge for both residents and tourists. To find a route in Luxembourg, [mobiliteit.lu](https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/) is a useful website providing real-time route suggestions.

There is a direct tram service, T1, departing from Luxembourg, Gare Centrale, and you may take off at Kirchberg, Universitéit station (Workshops and DC) or Mudam Philharmonie station (Main conference (9th and 10th of July)). For detailed timetable and real-time route suggestions, please visit [mobiliteit.lu](https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/).
