[ACM](https://acm.org "The Association for Computing Machinery") provides visa support letters to attendees, accepted authors (papers, posters), and members of the conference committee.

There are two ways to request a visa support letter—**please use only one method** to avoid delays:

<ol>
  <li><b>Fastest method: Request through registration</b>   
During the registration process, you will be prompted to enter the necessary information to generate a visa letter automatically through ACM. Letters are typically issued within <b>2 business days</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Alternative method (for accepted authors or committee members only): Email request</b>  
If you are not yet registering but require a visa letter (e.g., for early planning), send an email to **supportletters@acm.org**. Please allow up to **10 business days** for processing. Include the following in your request:
    <ul>
      <li>Full name (as it appears on your passport)</li>
      <li>Current postal mailing address</li>
      <li>Name of the conference: CUI 2025 – *Conversational User Interfaces*</li>
      <li>Registration confirmation number (if available)</li>
      <li>Title of your accepted paper or poster, and indicate if you are the “sole author” or a “co-author”</li>
      <li>If applicable, title of your presentation (for invited speakers)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol?>

All requests are processed in the order received.
