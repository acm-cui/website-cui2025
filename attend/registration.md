CUI {{ site.conference.year }} will be an in-person conference, and as such, our registration fees reflect running an in-person event. 

{% if page.registration_open %}
Registration for CUI {{ site.conference.year }} is now open.
{% else %}
We hope to open registration for CUI {{ site.conference.year }} very soon.
<!-- Online registration has now closed, and you must register on-site.-->
{% endif %}

Authors with papers accepted must register no later than **8th June 2024**. At least one author of each accepted paper, poster, DC, or demo must be registered to attend the conference in person. Any submission without a corresponding registration may be withheld from publication. We will support remote presentations only in an emergency (i.e., VISA being denied). 
Please ensure you register at the correct rate—if you do not, you will be liable to pay the difference. You can revise your registration online up to one week before the conference.

There are four different rates for registration at CUI {{ site.conference.year }} in-person and two different registration deadlines:

All registration fees above are inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT), which is charged at 17%. The registration system shows prices excluding VAT.

### Reduced rate for economically developing countries

CUI is committed to increasing the accessibility and diversity of the conference series. Following a tradition established a number of years ago, CUI 2024 is offering discounted registration to individuals based [in economically developing countries]({{ '/attend/discounted-registration/' | relative_url }} "Reduced Rate Eligibility for CUI {{ site.conference.year }}").

If eligible for the discount, you will be provided with a discount code at the end of the registration process that should be pasted into the discount text field for the discount to be applied.
