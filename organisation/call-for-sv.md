Student volunteers (SV) are an essential part of a successful conference. At CUI, you will help the organisation and make sure that everything runs smoothly during the conference.

You must be enrolled as a student during the summer term of 2024. We are more than happy to accept undergrad, graduate, and PhD students. What matters most is that you are friendly and enthusiastic about being part of CUI!

The Student Volunteer chairs will select a maximum of 8 SV giving priority to students applying from underrepresented communities and the global south. In addition, we will select 4 students to be put on the waitlist.

The call for SV will open on **{{ site.data.sv_dates.open }}** and will be closed on **{{ site.data.sv_dates.close }}**.

**We will be accepting IN-PERSON SVs for this year’s conference.**

The selection result will be announced on **{{ site.data.sv_dates.results }}**. Once you have a confirmed spot and registration is open you will be required to register. You will receive instructions on how to do this after your application is confirmed. If you are placed on the waitlist and a spot becomes available, you will be informed about this immediately.

If you register before selections are announced, your registration will be refunded.

## What will I do when I volunteer?

For CUI {{ site.conference.year }} SVs, you will agree to:

* Work at least 16 hours (if you are presenting a paper, we will make sure you do not have volunteer duties during that time)
* Show up on time to tasks
* Attend an orientation session Sunday afternoon
* Arrive at the conference by **Sunday morning** at the latest

In return, we commit to:

* Waive your registration fee
* Provide meals during the conference (coffee breaks and lunch)
* Free SV t-shirt to be collected on site

If you need to reach us, please always use the [{{ email }}](mailto:{{ email }}) address so that the two of us receive it. Reply-to-all on our correspondence so we all stay in the loop and can better help you.


## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Where can I find the form to apply?<br>
**A:** Through [this Google form](https://forms.gle/vzXomtgRQ72XzYZt5).

**Q:** I know the deadline for the application has passed, can I still be considered?<br>
**A:** Unfortunately, we will not be able to consider applications after the deadline has passed to make it fair for everyone who applied on time..

**Q:** I want to skip orientation, or work way less than 16 hours, or arrive later or leave earlier, can I still be an SV?<br>
**A:** Unless there are exceptional circumstances, no exceptions are made. If you have a very good reason that comes up after you already received a spot that means you won’t be able to fullfill your commitment, please send us an e-mail ([{{ email }}](mailto:{{ email }})) immediately and we will try to work with you as good as we can to accommodate your situation.

**Q:** I didn’t get your emails and/or forgot to register by the deadlines you guys sent us and I lost my spot as an SV, can I get it back?<br>
**A:** If this is due to serious and unexpected circumstances, please communicate them to us (to [{{ email }}](mailto:{{ email }})). We will try to be flexible, but if one of the SVs in the waiting list has already accepted, you may not get your spot back.


**We are looking forward to meeting all of you!**
