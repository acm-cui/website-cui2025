CUI {{ site.conference.year }} is delighted to hosted four topical workshops at the conference this year. Attendance at workshops requires [conference and workshop registration]({{"/attend/registration/" | relative_url}}) prior to the conference. Each workshop may have its own criteria for attendance (e.g., the submission of a position paper), thus you are advised to check details posted by workshop organisers in advance of the conference.
